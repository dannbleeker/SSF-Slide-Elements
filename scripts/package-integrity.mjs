/**
 * Whether a `.pptx` is INTERNALLY CONSISTENT — a structural check, not a
 * content one.
 *
 * Ported from SSF-Merge (`scripts/package-integrity.mjs`) on 2026-09-08; the
 * defects and false alarms its comments record were found there. A content
 * check asks whether a deck says the right things and knows one deck by heart.
 * This asks a question no deck is exempt from — do the parts, the
 * relationships and the markup agree — and it needs to know nothing about
 * what the deck is for.
 *
 * It exists because two defects found on 2026-08-29 were the same mistake in
 * two places, and neither was reachable by any gate that repository had. A pass
 * that deletes relationships knew ONE of the ways a slide names them, so it
 * deleted the others: a merged copy came out naming a relationship that was
 * gone, and — because deleting a relationship frees its id for the next thing
 * that needs one — another came out naming a relationship that led somewhere
 * else entirely. PowerPoint calls the first a damaged file. The second it opens
 * without complaint.
 *
 * The checks, and what each is for:
 *
 * - **dangling relationship** — a Target naming a part that is not in the
 *   package. The classic damaged-file cause.
 * - **unresolvable reference** — markup naming a relationship id the part does
 *   not have. The same damage seen from the other side, and the side that
 *   catches a relationship deleted out from under live markup.
 * - **mistyped reference** — a reference that resolves to a relationship of the
 *   wrong KIND: `<a:blip r:embed>` pointing at something that is not an image,
 *   `<p:tags r:id>` at something that is not a tag part. This is the one that
 *   catches an id reused after a delete, which the two checks above both pass.
 * - **undeclared part** — a part no content type covers, and an Override naming
 *   a part that is not there. PowerPoint refuses a package with either.
 * - **a character XML cannot carry** — a C0 control, an unpaired surrogate or
 *   `FFFE`/`FFFF` in the markup. The one problem that makes every check above
 *   moot, because a conforming parser refuses the part before it can disagree
 *   about anything in it.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT checked: whether a part is reachable from the presentation.
 * A stranded part is weight rather than damage, `orphanedParts` is where that
 * decision lives, and a checker that called it an error would fail on every
 * legitimately shared part it did not understand.
