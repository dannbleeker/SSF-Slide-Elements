/**
 * A file with its PROSE removed, so a guard reads what the file DOES.
 *
 * Three guards in a sibling repo went wrong the same way, each in a different
 * syntax, each found only when it went red on a file that was perfectly correct
 * or green on one that was not:
 *
 * - `test/architecture.test.ts` forbade Office.js in the engine, and matched the
 *   word "Office.js" in the paragraphs explaining WHY the engine avoids it —
 *   four correct files, red.
 * - `scripts/manifest-rules.mjs` forbade a `<Requirements>` block, and matched
 *   the XML comment explaining why the manifest has none — so the generator
 *   refused to write a file that was exactly right.
 * - `test/release.test.ts` checked that the pre-flight runs before the tag is
 *   created, and matched the YAML comment mentioning `gh release create` — so
 *   it compared the comment's position with the check's and reported the order
 *   backwards.
 *
 * A file that explains itself is not a defect; a guard that cannot tell an
 * explanation from an instruction is. Three strippers in three files is three
 * chances to write a fourth, so they are one module — and the next person
 * reaching for one finds it here rather than inventing it.
 *
 * None of these is a PARSER. Each is the smallest thing that makes its own
 * guard honest, and each is checked by `test/without-prose.test.ts` against the
 * case that caught it.
