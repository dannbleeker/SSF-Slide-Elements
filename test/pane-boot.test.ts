/**
 * The pane's entry point, as the browser sees it.
 *
 * Every other test here reaches past this file. `pane-render.test.ts` calls
 * `render` in jsdom; `scripts/pane-shots.mjs` imports `render.ts` directly in a
 * real browser and photographs the result. Both are useful and neither loads
 * `main.ts`, so for the whole life of a sibling repo its pane's actual entry point
 * had never run anywhere — and it could not have, because the page never loaded
 * Office.js. `Office.onReady` was a `ReferenceError` on the first statement, the
 * pane painted its header and stopped, and fourteen perfect screenshots said
 * nothing was wrong.
 *
 * The lesson generalises past this bug: a harness that mounts a component
 * bypasses the document that mounts it in production, so the document needs a
 * guard of its own.
