/**
 * Ported from SSF-Merge (`src/core/pptx/clone.ts`) on 2026-09-10, comments and
 * all, the way `pkg.ts` beside it was. Every incident the comments below
 * narrate happened THERE, in its merge engine: "the merge" is SSF-Merge's
 * merge, "the template" is the deck it merges records into, and "a copy" is one
 * merged row. The reasoning transfers because the operation is the same one —
 * duplicate a slide inside a package so PowerPoint takes the copy and not the
 * original.
 *
 * This add-in duplicates a slide for a different reason. An element lands "onto
 * this slide" by rebuilding that slide with the element spliced into it and
 * handing PowerPoint the rebuild; the original is then removed by position.
 * `src/core/splice/` is what calls this.

/**
 * Clone a slide inside the package.
 *
 * Six things have to agree or PowerPoint reports the deck as damaged, and it
 * does that by refusing to open the file without saying which one was wrong:
 * the part, its relationships, the content-type override, the presentation
 * relationship, the slide id list, and the creation id.
 *
 * The creation id is the one that is easy to miss and expensive to get wrong.
 * Office.js reports a slide as `256#3561048925`, which is `<p:sldId id>` joined
 * to `<p14:creationId val>` from the slide's own `extLst`. Re-inserting a slide
 * that carries a creation id already in the deck asks the host to hold one
 * identity twice, and office-js#6105 reports exactly that failing with
 * `InvalidArgument` on Windows desktop. Every copy gets a fresh one.
