/**
 * Every relationship id this part's markup names, whatever names it.
 *
 * The question is "may this relationship go", and the only safe way to ask it
 * is of the WHOLE document: any attribute in the relationship namespace is a
 * reference, and a reference means the relationship has to stay.
 *
 * Two callers ask it, and they ask the same question: `dropUnusedImageRels`,
 * deciding which image relationships a merged copy still needs, and
 * `dropInheritedTags`, deciding which of the template's tag and comment
 * relationships may go with the reference it just removed. Both got it wrong in
 * the same way before this existed, and a second reader would be free to get it
 * wrong again — the answer belongs in one place.
 *
 * This began as `a:blip/@r:embed`, which is where a picture's image sits and is
 * not the only place an image id appears. Two of them are ordinary:
 *
 * - `<asvg:svgBlip r:embed="…">`, inside the blip's own extension list. That is
 *   how PowerPoint stores an ICON — a raster fallback in the blip and the real
 *   SVG beside it, under a SECOND image relationship. Icons are everywhere in a
 *   modern deck.
 * - `<a:blip r:link="…">`, a picture LINKED rather than embedded.
 *
 * Neither is an `r:embed` on an `a:blip`, so both relationships were dropped
 * from a merged copy whose slide still referenced them — a slide naming a
 * relationship that is not there, which is precisely what PowerPoint calls a
 * damaged file. It needed a modern chart on the slide to fire, because that is
 * what runs this pass at all, but nothing about the shape is exotic.
 *
 * Reading every `r:`-namespaced attribute rather than a list of the ones known
 * today is the conservative direction: an unknown reference keeps a
 * relationship that could have gone, where a missed one breaks the file. The
 * fallback picture is still dropped, because the replacement takes its `<p:pic>`
 * out of the document first and its id is then named by nothing.
 *
 * Matched by namespace OR by prefix. `getAttributeNS` was already paired with a
 * `getAttribute("r:embed")` fallback here for the same reason: a document that
 * came out of a host may not carry the namespace where a reader expects it.

/**
 * Characters no XML document may contain, in any spelling.
 *
 * XML 1.0's `Char` production excludes most of the C0 controls, the lone
 * surrogates and `FFFE`/`FFFF`, and there is no escape for them either —
 * `&#11;` is exactly as ill-formed as the raw character. So a cell carrying one
 * cannot reach a slide by any route, and nothing upstream stops it:
 * `@xmldom/xmldom` writes such a character straight through and reads it back
 * again, so the part serialises, the suite sees a perfectly good document, and
 * every gate in that repo was green. PowerPoint parses conformingly, refuses the
 * part, and calls the whole file damaged — a finished merge lost entirely, with
 * no message naming the cell that did it.
 *
 * Reachable from an ordinary paste rather than from anything exotic.
 * `CHAR(11)` is the line break WORD keeps inside a cell, and a NUL is what a
 * mis-decoded UTF-16 export leaves behind.
 *
 * **Not Excel's, and this sentence used to say it was.** Alt+Enter puts
 * `CHAR(10)` in the cell and a bare LF on the clipboard, and LF is LEGAL XML —
 * so it never reaches this set, passed every gate in SSF-Merge, and DrawingML
 * rendered it as a hard break across five parts of a merged deck until the
 * desktop round of 2026-08-31 looked at one. A wrong sentence here is what sent
 * that round's own check at the wrong character.
 *
 * SSF-Merge keeps its rule for a legal-but-unwanted break in its own resolve
 * step, apart from this on purpose: this is about what XML cannot carry from
 * any source, that is about what a CELL may hold.
 *
 * Replaced with a SPACE rather than dropped, because the likeliest one is a
 * line break: dropping it joins two words that were separate — "AdaLovelace" —
 * and a space cannot make that mistake in the other direction.
 *
 * This is the one place text is changed without being asked, and the
 * usual answer — show what the user typed and let them see it — is not
 * available: the character has no representation in the output format at all,
 * so every option alters it and only this one leaves a file that opens.
 *
 * Astral characters are NOT touched. A well-formed surrogate pair is one code
 * point above `FFFF`, which `\p{Surrogate}` under the `u` flag does not match;
 * only an unpaired half does, and an unpaired half is already broken text.
